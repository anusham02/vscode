<div class="content"> A home page is generally the primary web page which a visitor navigating to a website from a search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors.[3][4] Thus good home page design is usually a high priority for a website.[5] For example, a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[6]>

<div class="content"> A service is a transaction in which no physical goods are transferred from the seller to the buyer. The benefits of such a service are held to be demonstrated by the buyer's willingness to make the exchange. Public services are those that society as a whole pays for. Wikipedia</div>
